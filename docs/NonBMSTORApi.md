Non-BM STOR events (NONBM)

This endpoint provides data about the start of NGESO Short Term Operating Reserves (STOR) events. This is  activity that is outside of the Balancing Mechanism and takes place to meet the need to  increase generation or decrease demand. Each result has a non-zero generation value which was preceded by a zero  generation value.                By default, the before parameter filters the data by start time. If the settlementPeriodBefore parameter is  provided, the before parameter instead filters on settlement date, allowing for searching by start time or  settlement date & settlement period.  Note: When filtering via settlement date, before is treated as a Date only, with the time being ignored. For  example, 2022-06-01T00:00Z and 2022-06-01T11:11Z are both treated as the settlement date 2022-06-01.                All Dates and DateTimes should be expressed as defined within  <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 3339</a>.                Some examples of date parameter combinations are shown below.                Filtering latest 3 events:                    /balancing/nonbm/stor/events?count=3                Filtering latest 3 events before start time:                    /balancing/nonbm/stor/events?before=2022-08-01T00:00Z&count=3                Filtering latest 3 events before settlement date and settlement period:                    /balancing/nonbm/stor/events?before=2022-08-01T00:00Z&settlementPeriodBefore=48&count=3

### Example
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import elexonpy
from elexonpy.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = elexonpy.NonBMSTORApi()
count = 56 # int | Format - int32. The number of events to return.
before = '2013-10-20T19:20:30+01:00' # datetime | Format - date-time (as date-time in RFC3339). If specified, filters events to those with a start time before or at the date, or a settlement date before the date if  settlementPeriodBefore is also specified.  If omitted, latest events are returned. (optional)
settlement_period_before = 56 # int | Format - int32. Filters events to those with a settlement period before or at the value.  Before parameter must be specified if this is specified. (optional)
format = 'format_example' # str | Response data format. Use json/xml to include metadata. (optional)

try:
    # Non-BM STOR events (NONBM)
    api_response = api_instance.get_balancing_nonbm_stor_events_count_count(count, before=before, settlement_period_before=settlement_period_before, format=format)
    pprint(api_response)

Non-BM STOR time series (NONBM)

This endpoint provides data about the Short Term Operating Reserves (STOR) that have been made use of  by NGESO. This is activity that is outside of the Balancing Mechanism and takes place to meet the need to  increase generation or decrease demand.                By default, the from and to parameters filter the data by time inclusively. If the settlementPeriodFrom or  settlementPeriodTo parameters are provided, the corresponding from or to parameter instead filters on settlement  date, allowing for searching by a combination of time and/or settlement date & settlement period.  Note: When filtering via settlement date, from/to are treated as Dates only, with the time being ignored. For  example, 2022-06-01T00:00Z and 2022-06-01T11:11Z are both treated as the settlement date 2022-06-01.                All Dates and DateTimes should be expressed as defined within  <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 3339</a>.                Some examples of date parameter combinations are shown below.
