Balancing services volume (QAS)

This endpoint provides balancing services volume data received from NGESO, with an added computed 'Time' field.  (The time field is calculated from the settlement date & period and represents the earliest possible time for  for which the datapoint applies)                Balancing services volume is a volume which is received from the System Operator, which represents the volume  of energy (MWh) associated with the provision of Applicable Balancing Services for each relevant BM Unit and  Settlement Period.    QAS can be positive or negative and is normally only provided where there is a non-zero volume.                By default, the from and to parameters filter the data by time inclusively. If the settlementPeriodFrom or  settlementPeriodTo parameters are provided, the corresponding from or to parameter instead filters on settlement  date, allowing for searching by a combination of time and/or settlement date & settlement period.  Note: When filtering via settlement date, from/to are treated as Dates only, with the time being ignored. For  example, 2022-06-01T00:00Z and 2022-06-01T11:11Z are both treated as the settlement date 2022-06-01.                All Dates and DateTimes should be expressed as defined within  <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 3339</a>.                Some examples of date parameter combinations are shown below.
